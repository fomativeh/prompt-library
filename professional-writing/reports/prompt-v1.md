### **Prompt: Executive Summary Generator**

**Objective:** Generate a one-page executive summary based on key points.

**Prompt:**
```
Write a one-page executive summary for a quarterly product performance report using the notes below. Keep it under 250 words. Include: highlights, risks, next steps.

Notes:
- Q2 revenue +18% QoQ; ARR $1.2M
- Churn 3.1% (up from 2.4%); main cause: onboarding friction
- Launched Teams plan; 22 pilot customers; NPS 54
- Infra: API latency down 30%; 2 P1 incidents, resolved <2h
- Pipeline: 40 qualified leads; 12 enterprise in late-stage
- Next: Improve onboarding, expand Teams plan GA in Q3
```

**Example Output:**
Q2 delivered strong topline growth with revenue up 18% QoQ and ARR reaching $1.2M, driven by early traction from the new Teams plan (22 pilots) and improved platform performance (API latency down 30%). Customer sentiment remains positive (NPS 54).

The primary risk is rising churn (3.1%, up from 2.4%), attributed to onboarding friction for new accounts. While two P1 incidents occurred, both were resolved within two hours and did not materially impact SLAs.

Looking ahead to Q3, we will prioritize reducing onboarding friction and moving the Teams plan to general availability. Commercial focus remains on converting 12 late-stage enterprise opportunities and expanding the top of funnel (40 qualified leads). Overall, momentum is strong, with product readiness and sales pipeline supporting continued growth.
