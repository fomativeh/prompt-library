Hi Maria,

I hope you’re well. Unfortunately, a conflicting deadline has come up on my end, and I won’t be able to make our 3 PM meeting on Tuesday. I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Could we reschedule for Wednesday or Thursday between 2–5 PM? If those times don’t work, I’m happy to adjust to a time that’s best for you.

Thank you for your flexibility, and I look forward to our conversation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
