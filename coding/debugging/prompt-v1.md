### **Prompt: Bug Identifier and Fixer**

**Objective:** Identify bugs in code and provide corrected versions with explanations of what was wrong and why the fix works.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze this Python code for bugs and provide a corrected version. Explain what's wrong and how to fix it:

def process_user_data(users):
    results = []
    for user in users:
        name = user['name']
        age = user['age']
        if age >= 18:
            status = 'adult'
        else:
            status = 'minor'
        results.append({'name': name, 'status': status})
    return results

# Test data
users = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 17},
    {'name': 'Charlie'}  # Missing age field
]
result = process_user_data(users)
```

**Example Output:**
The code will fail with a `KeyError` when it tries to access `user['age']` for the third user (Charlie), since that dictionary doesn't contain an 'age' key.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def process_user_data(users):
    results = []
    for user in users:
        name = user.get('name', 'Unknown')
        age = user.get('age', 0)
        
        if age >= 18:
            status = 'adult'
        else:
            status = 'minor'
        
        results.append({'name': name, 'status': status})
    return results
```

The fix uses `.get()` method with default values instead of direct key access, which prevents the KeyError when keys are missing.
