### **Prompt: Lesson Plan Generator**

**Objective:** Create a 45-minute lesson plan with objectives, materials, activities, and assessment.

**Prompt:**
```
Create a concise 45-minute lesson plan for Grade 6 on "Photosynthesis". Include:
- Learning objectives (2-3)
- Materials
- Lesson activities (intro, guided practice, independent practice)
- Assessment (exit ticket)
- Differentiation tips
```

**Example Output:**
**Topic:** Photosynthesis (Grade 6) — 45 minutes

**Objectives:**
- Define photosynthesis and identify required inputs (CO₂, water, light) and outputs (glucose, oxygen)
- Describe the role of chlorophyll and leaves

**Materials:**
- Plant diagram handout, green/blue sticky notes, projector

**Activities:**
- Warm-up (5m): Think-pair-share—“How do plants eat?”
- Direct instruction (10m): Mini-lesson with diagram; annotate inputs/outputs
- Guided practice (15m): Label parts on handout; color-code inputs/outputs with sticky notes
- Independent practice (10m): Short paragraph: “Explain photosynthesis in your own words”
- Wrap-up (5m): Share 2 student answers

**Assessment (Exit ticket):**
- Write the equation for photosynthesis in words

**Differentiation:**
- Provide sentence starters; allow drawing instead of writing for ELLs
- Challenge: Ask advanced students to connect light intensity to rate
